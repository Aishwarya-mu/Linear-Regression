Linear Regression

Linear Regression is one of the most fundamental and widely known Machine Learning Algorithms which people start with. Building blocks of a Linear Regression Model are:

Discreet/continuous independent variables

A best-fit regression line

Continuous dependent variable. i.e., A Linear Regression model predicts the dependent variable using a regression line based on the independent variables. The equation of the Linear Regression is:

                                          Y=a+b*X + e 
Where, a is the intercept, b is the slope of the line, and e is the error term. The equation above is used to predict the value of the target variable based on the given predictor variable(s).

Here, I will also try to deploy a simple linear regression project with the admission dataset. I have deployed it on GCP(Google cloud platform).
